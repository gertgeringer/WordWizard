# ðŸ§™ WordWizard

Welcome to **WordWizard**, a cross-platform desktop application designed to evaluate word reading speed.

## Overview

WordWizard is a tool primarily designed for educators, providing a simple and engaging way for students to improve their
reading skills. The application presents a list of words to the student, recording the time taken to read them. This
allows for a quantifiable measure of a student's reading speed, aiding in their linguistic development.

WordWizard is built using a robust and modern tech stack:

* Rust: A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Tauri](https://tauri.app/): A framework for building lightweight, secure desktop apps with web technologies.
* [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/): A React components and hooks library for building
  flawless user interfaces.
